# High School Profile Paper

This is the repository for the files I mention in my highschool essay about artificial intelligence. This is for demonstration only, not meant to be ran so expect unoptimized code.

## Tic-Tac-Toe AI
I coded a tic-tac-toe AI to compare how long it takes to code an AI by hand as to building and training a supervised ML model. It took 5 hours. 
As of writing this I think I'm going to do RPC or IPC between Python and C++ to test if the coded AI can outperform the ML AI.
