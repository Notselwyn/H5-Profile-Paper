# HS-Essay

This is the repository for the files I mention in my highschool essay about artificial intelligence. This is for demonstration only, not meant to be ran so expect unoptimized code.

## Tic-Tac-Toe AI
I coded a tic-tac-toe AI to compare how long it takes to code an AI by hand as to building and training a reinforced ML model. It took 5 hours. 
As of writing this I think I'm going to do RPC or IPC between Python and Node.js on my website, and train the AI based on user input on Node.js.
